(** A lexer is a restartable parser where the tokens are characters.
 *)
module type LEXER =
sig
    (**

        A lexer analyses a stream of characters and groups the stream of
        characters into tokens. It usually strips off whitespace. I.e. a lexer
        expects a stream of characters of the form
        {v
            WS Token WS Token ... WS Token WS EOS
         v}
        [WS] is a possibly empty sequence of whitespace characters like
        blanks, tabs and newlines and comments. [Token] represents a legal
        token. [EOS] represents the end of the stream.


        A lexer is in one of three states:

        - {!needs_more}: The lexer needs more characters from the stream of
        characters in order to decide the next correct token or the end of
        input. The lexer is ready to receive more characters via {!put} or to
        receive the end of input via {!put_end}.

       - {!has_succeeded}: The lexer has found a correct token or detected the
       end of input. In this state (except at the end of inpute) the lexer can
       be restarted to find the next token.

       - {!has_failed_syntax}: The lexer has detected a character (or the end of
       intput) which cannot be part of a legal token.

       In the state {!has_succeeded} the lexer signals via {!has_consumed_end}
       that the end of input has been reached.

       A module conforming to the module type [LEXER] can be used in the module
       {!module:Parse_with_lexer} to create a two stage parser where the lexer
       handles tokens and a combinator parser handles the higher level
       constructs.

        A lexer does not consume the entire input stream. It just consumes
        characters until a token has been recognized. In case of the successful
        recognition of a token, it returns the token (see {!type-final}). Then it can
        be restarted to recognize the next token.

        A parser [p] is a sink of token. As long as it signals [needs_more p]
        more token can be pushed into the parser via [put token p] or the input
        stream can be ended via [put_end p].

        [has_result p] is equivalent to [not (needs_more p)]. [has_result p]
        signals that the parser has either succeeded or failed.

        If it has succeeded the final value is available via [final p].

        There are two types of failure:

        - Syntax error: In that case [failed_expectations p] returns the list of
        failed expectations.

        - Semantic error: In that case [failed_semantic p] returns the
        encountered semantic error.


       The function [state] returns the user state.

       The function [lookaheads] returns a pair. The first part of the pair is
       an array of unprocessed lookahead token and the second part is a flag
       indicating if the endtoken has been received via [put_end].

        [p <?> expect] is equivalent to [p].

        If [p] fails without consuming token, then the failed expectations are
        replaced with the failed expectation [expect].

        Usually [p] is a combinator implementing a choice between various
        alternatives of a grammar construct. The [<?>] combinator allows to
        replace the set of failed grammar alternatives with a higher abstraction
        of the failed expectation.  E.g. instead of getting the failed
        expectations [identifier], ['('], [-], ...  we can get the failed
        expectation [expression].
    *)


    val no_expectations: 'a t -> 'a t

        - [p] fails: [no_expectations p] fails with the same error.

        - [p] succeeds without consuming tokens: [no_expectations p] succeeds
        without any added expectations.

        - [p] succeeds and consumes some token: [no_expectations p] succeeds
        without any expectations.

        Many combinators can succeed with expectations. E.g. the combinator
        {{!optional} [optional p]} expects a [p] and succeeds if it does not
        encounter a construct described by [p]. All repetitive combinators like
        {!one_or_more} try to consume as many items as possible. At the end they
        are still expecting an item.

        This combinator allows to clear such unneeded expectations. It is
        particularly useful when removing whitespace. The expectation of
        whitespace is not a meaningful error message to the user.

        After successful parsing the function [make] is called with the final

        - [binary_operator] parses a binary operator.

        Precondition: [primary], [unary_operator] and [binary_operator] have to
        consume at least one token in case of success. Otherwise infinite
        recursion can happen.

    (** {2 Backtracking} *)


    val backtrack: 'a t -> expect -> 'a t
    (** [backtrack p expect]

        Try the combinator [p]. In case of failure with consuming token, push
        the consumed token back to the lookahead and let it fail without
        consuming token. Use [expect] to record the failed expectation.

        Backtracking reduces the performance, because the token pushed back to
        the lookahead have to be parsed again. Try to avoid backtracking
        whenever possible.
    *)


    val followed_by: 'a t -> expect -> 'a t
    (** [followed_by p expect]

        Parses [p] and backtracks (i.e. all tokens of [p] will be pushed back to
        the lookahead). In case [p] succeeds, the [followed_by] parser
        succeeds without consuming token. Otherwise it fails without consuming
        tokens.
    *)

    val not_followed_by: 'a t -> expect -> unit t
    (** [not_followed_by p expect]

        Parses [p] and backtracks (i.e. all tokens of [p] will be pushed back to
        the lookahead). In case [p] succeeds, the [not_followed_by] parser
        fails without consuming token. Otherwise it succeeds without consuming
        tokens.
    *)

    (** [followed_by] and [not_followed_by] can be used to peek into the token
        stream without consuming token. *)
